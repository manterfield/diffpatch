# To Do List

- [ ] Minify/compress/etc the JS package
- [ ] Automate tag and release creation in GitHub. Use the go version as a basic tag, create an @mantty/diffpatch prefixed tag for JS changes
- [ ] Make sure version change detection is better than 'changed in this commit' - check current version against tags in the repo. Only release under each tag when they have been bumped
- [ ] Create a unified testing script to test and compare both packages + interoperability of the output
